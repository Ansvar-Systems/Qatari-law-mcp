In June 2004 Qatar issued a Permanent Constitution that regulates the three authorities and outlines the rights and duties of citizens.\nAlthough Qatar is currently witnessing progress in economic, technical and social aspects, it has managed to preserve its cultural traditions and values ​​as an Arab and Islamic State that considers the family the main Cornerstone of society. Thanks to the wise leadership of His Highness the Emir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the State continues to implement many important initiatives that will raise the State of Qatar to the ranks of developed countries and enhance its great role in the international community.\nIn light of this prosperity, the State of Qatar stands at a crossroads. Qatar's abundant wealth offers multiple opportunities for development and presents major challenges at the same time.\nIt's imperative that Qatar choose the optimum path that is in line with the wishes of its leadership and aspirations of its people.\nthe State of Qatar futuristic vision determines future's general trends and highlights values ​​that reflect aspirations, goals and culture of the people of Qatar. By shining a light on the future, the vision will show the basic options available to the Qatari community.\nAt the same time, it harnesses the potential of Qataris to develop common goals that guide their future. This vision is concerned with the intended general results, not the details of reaching them. It is a general framework through which more detailed strategies and implementation plans can be prepared.\nThe National Vision aims to transform Qatar by 2030 into a developed State capable of achieving sustainable development and ensuring the continued decent living of its people, generation after another.\nSpecific features for the State of Qatar Future Chances and Challenges\nQatar's good governance of its abundant hydrocarbon resources guarantees significant improvements in quality of life for future generations. But improvements in the quality of life cannot be the only goal in a recovering community. In order for Qatar to remain faithful to its values, it must deal with five main challenges, which is to balance the following options:\n• Challenges and maintaining traditions. • Current and future generation's needs. • Targeted growth and uncontrolled expansion. • Development path, size and quality of targeted migrant workers. • Economic and social development, environmental protection and development.\nModernization and Maintaining Traditions Maintaining our traditions is one of the most important challenges facing many societies in a world characterized by a shift towards globalization and increased interaction between peoples. Outstanding pace of economic growth and population expansion in Qatar has brought to light this problem clearly. The result is that the new may clash with the old in every aspect of life. Modern work patterns and pressures of competitiveness sometimes clash with traditional relationships based on trust and personal knowledge, and overburden family life in various forms. Progress along with broader freedoms and more diverse choices also challenges the traditional and authentic values ​​embedded in society.\nHowever, it is possible to combine modern lifestyles with society's values ​​and culture. There are societies that have successfully adapted modernization to local traditions and culture. Qatar National Vision responds to this challenge and aims to link the old to modern in a balanced way.\nCurrent and future generation's needs Qatar will meet the needs of the current generation and safeguard the rights of future generations.\nSustainable development is a process that seeks to meet the needs of the current generation without sacrificing the ability of future generations to achieve their needs, and this is known as inter-equity. The rights of future generations may be at risk if depleted hydrocarbon resources are depleted without being replaced by other renewable resources, and we can find this at least in three cases:\nLow returns on wealth from hydrocarbon revenues, exaggerated spending, especially on high-cost, cost-effective, demonstration projects, and rapid economic development that leads to economic stress and damage to the natural environment. Qatar National Vision will confuse the development path that balances the benefit of the present generation with the benefit of future generations.\nTargeted growth and uncontrolled expansion Qatar wants to make rapid progress, but what can be achieved is limited by speed limits. Qatar is witnessing a major expansion in its economic activities. However, this expansion may lead to depletion of resources and straining the economy, thus weakening the Cornerstones of progress or delinquency from its intended course.\nThe effects of this stress are shown by the rapid rise in prices, and its continuation will lead to financial fragility, low level of government services, low work efficiency, a deterioration in the quality of projects and a delay in their completion dates, damage to the environment and expansion in cracks between groups and segments of society.\nTherefore, Qatar must move at a rate of speed in line with realistic aspirations for a sustainable improvement in the quality of life and quality of life, and aim at growth rates that are in line with the economy's ability to truly expand.\nDevelopment course, size and quality of targeted migrant workers Qatar must choose its development path that meets its requirements with the quantity and quality of targeted employment, which is up to the people of Qatar and their leadership.\nQatar is experiencing rapid population growth due in large part to the continuous increase in the expatriate workforce accompanying rapid economic growth and the resulting expansion of construction and investment projects and a steady increase in government spending. All of this has led to a significant increase in the proportion of expats in the workforce, in particular to an ill-considered and unexpected increase in the size of unskilled labor.\nAs the demographics determine the nature of society, Qatar must decide the size and quality of the expatriate labor appropriate through a balance between the cultural rights entailed in attracting this employment and the housing and public services needs and possible negative effects on the national identity on the one hand, and the economic benefits expected from Increasing the percentage of expats in the total workforce from another side.\nThe path of socio-economic development, environmental protection and development Development and environmental protection are two demands that cannot be sacrificed to one another in the interest of the other. Development patterns have varying negative impacts on the environment. These impacts can be mitigated by investing in the latest technologies that aim to reduce the damage that different economic projects leave to the environment, and these damages can also be mitigated by avoiding rapid, unexplained growth. However, these damages cannot be completely avoided, especially in a development pattern that initially depends on the oil, gas, petrochemical and heavy industries. Qatar is currently committed to applying international standards for environmental protection when designing and implementing these projects. They also have to commit to making the future development path compatible with environmental protection requirements. Where economic progress has an environmental price, it must be compensated for by investing in other alternatives that improve the environment.\nHowever, Qatar's efforts alone to protect the environment are not enough. Qatar is part of the Gulf region, which constitutes one environmental system affected by the practices and activities of each State in the Gulf. Therefore, there is a need for coordination and cooperation between these countries in all activities that protect and conserve the environment.\nThe next step for the Future Vision project is to clarify the choices for each of the aforementioned features.\nPrinciples Leading our National Vision Qatar National Vision is based on the guidelines of the Permanent Constitution and the directives of His Highness, Emir Hamad and Sheikha Mozah, and on extensive consultations with government institutions and local and international experts. The National Vision aims to establish a society based on justice, charity and equality. It also embodies the principles of a Permanent Constitution that:\n• Safeguard public and personal freedoms.\n• It protects moral and religious values ​​and traditions.\n• Ensures security, stability and equal opportunities. Vision Cornerstones National Vision is based on four Cornerstones:\nHuman Development: the development and development of the population of the State of Qatar so that they can build a prosperous society.\nSocial Development: Developing a just and safe society based on good morals and social welfare and able to interact and interact with other societies and play an important role in the global partnership for development.\nEconomic Development: The development of a diversified and competitive national economy capable of meeting the needs of the citizens of Qatar today and in the future and ensuring a high quality of life.\nEnvironmental Development: Managing the environment in a manner that ensures harmony and harmony between economic and social development and environmental protection.\nFirst Cornerstone - Human Development Qatar's development to date has mainly depended on oil and gas exploitation, but this hydrocarbon source is depleting. And economic success in the future will depend more and more on the ability of the Qatari people to interact and interact with the new world order that is based on knowledge and is very competitive. This is done by building advanced health and educational systems that provide the best educational and health services and developing a workforce that stimulates development in which national labor participates effectively and is strengthened by skilled expatriate workers.\nThe State of Qatar aims to build an educational system that keeps pace with modern international standards and aligns with the best educational systems in the world. This system provides opportunities for citizens to develop their capabilities and provides them with the best training methods.\nTo be able to succeed in a changing world whose scientific requirements are increasing. This system also encourages analytical and critical thinking, develops creativity and innovation, and emphasizes the promotion of social cohesion and respect for the values and heritage of Qatari society. It calls for constructive engagement with the peoples of the world. To support the desired educational system, Qatar aspires to be an effective center for scientific research and intellectual activity. (Education is one of the basic pillars of social progress. The State shall ensure, foster and promote education.)\nPermanent Constitution\nTo improve the health of the Qatari community, Qatar is working to develop an integrated health care system that provides high-quality preventive and curative health services managed according to the best international standards, and provides the current generation and future generations with a long healthy life, and its facilities are available to all residents and fees they can afford. (The State shall foster public health, provide the means of prevention of disease and epidemics, and promote their cure in accordance with the Law.)\nPermanent Constitution\nAs for the workforce, Qatar will increase the effective participation of national labor. In the foreseeable future, however, the population of Qatar is not sufficient to deal with systems, infrastructure and other requirements for rapid growth in a complex and technologically complex economy. So achieving aspirations of the future vision requires filling the shortage of the national workforce with migrant workers. To attract and retain the right combination of skills requires the provision of appropriate incentives and the establishment of regulatory procedures to preserve the rights of migrant workers and ensure their safety. (The relationship between workers and employers is based on social justice and regulated by law)\nPermanent Constitution\nTargeted Goals:\nEducated People: An educational system that lives up to the world’s distinguished educational systems and provides citizens with what meets their needs and the needs of the Qatari community, and includes:\n• Education curricula and training programs that respond to current and future labor market needs.\n• High-quality educational and training opportunities commensurate with aspirations and capabilities of each individual.\n• Longlisting learning programs available to everyone.\nA national network for formal and informal education equips Qatari children and youth with the necessary skills and high motivation to contribute to building and advancing their society, working to:\n• Building values ​​and traditions of the Qatari community and preserving its heritage.\n• Encouraging young people to be creative, innovative and capable.\n• Instilling a sense of belonging and citizenship.\n• Participate in a wide range of cultural and sports activities.\nDeveloped and independent educational institutions that are efficiently and self-managed, according to central guidelines and subject to accountability.\nAn effective system for financing scientific research based on the principle of partnership between the public and private sectors in cooperation with the relevant international bodies and prestigious global research centers.\nAn active international role in the fields of cultural and intellectual activity and scientific research.\nPhysically and Mentally Healthy Population:\nA comprehensive healthcare system that meets the best international standards and enables all residents to access and benefit from its services, based on:\nEstablishing fees that everyone can afford based on the principle of sharing costs.\n• Cover all aspects of preventive and curative health care, and care for both physical and mental health, taking into account the different needs of men, women and children.\n• High-quality health research aimed at improving the efficiency and quality of health care services.\nAn integrated health care system that provides its services at the highest quality through public and private health institutions, guided by a national health policy that includes specific standards and monitors the economic, social, financial, administrative and technical aspects of the system.\nBuilding national leaders capable of providing the best health services.\nAn ongoing commitment by the State to provide adequate funding to protect the health of citizens does not eliminate the principle of partnership in bearing health care costs.\nAn efficient workforce and committed to work ethics An increased and diversified participation of Qataris in the workforce through: Wide investments of public and private sector institutions in qualification and training programs.\n• Provide incentives to Qataris to encourage them to occupy higher technical and managerial occupations in the business, health and education sectors.\n• Finding high-quality training opportunities for all citizens, each according to his ambitions and capabilities.\n• Increase job opportunities for Qatari women and support them professionally.\nTargeted participation of expats: Attracting the desired combination of expatriate workers, caring for their rights, ensuring their safety, and preserving those with distinguished skills.\nSecond Cornerstone - Social Development\nThe State of Qatar is looking forward to the advancement and development of the social field by building the Qatari human being able to deal with merit and flexibility with the requirements of his time, and to maintain a strong, cohesive family that enjoys support, care and social protection. In this society, women will have an active role in all aspects of life, especially the aspect of participation in economic and political decision-making. The family is the basis of society. A Qatari family is founded on religion, ethics and patriotism. The Law shall regulate as necessary to protect the family, support its structure, strengthen its ties and protect mothers, children and the elderly.\nPermanent Constitution\nQatar will work to provide security and stability for the population, and to secure basic needs and ensure equal opportunities for citizens. It will also work to promote a spirit of tolerance and charity and encourage constructive dialogue and openness to other cultures in harmony with its Arab and Islamic identity. (The State safeguards the Cornerstones of society, guarantees security and stability, and provides citizens with opportunities)\nPermanent Constitution\n(Qatari society is based on the Cornerstones of justice, benevolence, freedom, equality and good morals.\nPermanent Constitution\nQatar will also work to enhance its important and constructive regional role, especially within the Gulf Cooperation Council system, the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. As a responsible member of the international community, Qatar will contribute to achieving global peace and security and implement its international obligations.\nTargeted Goals: Welfare and Social Protection\n• Maintaining a strong, cohesive family that looks after its children and adheres to moral and religious values ​​and ideals.\n• Building an effective social protection system for all Qataris, which takes into account their civil rights, values ​​their active participation in the development of society, and provides them with sufficient income to maintain dignity and health.\nCommunity structure Building effective public institutions and active and strong civil society organizations that contribute to:\n• Preserving the national cultural heritage and promoting Arab and Islamic values ​​and identity.\n• Providing high quality services that respond to the needs and desires of individuals and economic facilities.\n• Building a safe and stable society driven by the principles of justice, equality and the rule of law.\n• Enhancing women's capabilities and enabling them to participate economically and politically, especially those related to decision-making.\n• To cultivate and develop a spirit of tolerance, constructive dialogue and openness to others at the national and international levels.\nInternational Cooperation\n• Enhancing Qatar's regional economic, political and cultural role, especially in the framework of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\n• Intensifying and enhancing cultural exchange with the Arab peoples in particular and other peoples in general.\n• To nurture and support dialogue among civilizations and coexistence between different religions and cultures.\nContributing to achieving global peace and security through political initiatives and development and humanitarian aid.\nThird Cornerstone - Economic Development\nQatari economy is the foundation upon which economic prosperity and continuous rise in the quality of life shall be enhanced. However, sustaining prosperity requires prudent management of depleted resources to ensure that future generations have sufficient resources and capabilities to meet their aspirations. This administration should ensure the optimal utilization of these resources and create a balance between reserves and production, and between economic diversification and depletion.\nQatar's abundant hydrocarbonic resources can be invested to make sustainable development a reality. Transforming these natural resources into financial wealth becomes a means to achieve the following: investing in world-class infrastructure, building effective mechanisms to provide public services, building a skilled and highly productive workforce, and supporting the development of entrepreneurial and innovation capabilities. These accomplishments, if taken in turn, provide a broader platform to diversify the economy and turn Qatar into a regional hub for knowledge, industrial activities and high-value services. However, the challenges should not be underestimated. The State shall guarantee freedom of economic enterprise on the basis of social justice and balanced cooperation between private and public activity in order to achieve socio-economic development, increase production, ensure public welfare, raise the quality of life and provide job opportunities in accordance with the provisions of the Law.\nPermeant Constitution\nFirst Challenge is for the private sector to play a fundamental role in achieving sustainable development. The future vision assumes that training and supporting entrepreneurs is a prerequisite for enabling the private sector to play the role required of it, in addition to providing financial and non-financial support mechanisms that will embrace and develop small and medium enterprises. Qatar has made great progress in developing a political and regulatory climate that supports the business sector. However, more steps are still needed to enhance competitiveness and attract investment in a dynamic international economy that is not constrained by geographical borders.\nSecond Challenge will be to choose and manage a path that will thrive and avoid economic imbalances and tensions. When inflation becomes rooted or when rapid development processes are implemented, or when public services become unable to meet increased needs, the risks to sustainable prosperity and social cohesion increase. Skilled and far-sighted economic management and effective and active institutions will be needed to reduce the effects of these risks.\nQatar's economic strategy must be aware of a number of risks that may limit the achievement of its ambitions. The best guarantee for preventing these risks is open and flexible markets, affordable social protection mechanisms, and strategic and preventive financial reserves.\nTargeted Goals: Good Economic Governance\n• Acceptable and sustainable economic growth rates to maintain a high quality of life for the current and future generations.\n• Financial and economic stability characterized by low inflation rates, sound financial policy, and an efficient and safe financial system.\n• A stimulating investment climate capable of attracting foreign funds and technologies and encouraging national investments.\n• An open, flexible and competitive economic environment in a changing world.\nCoordination with the countries of Cooperation Council and cooperation with Arab, regional and international economic organizations to establish trade, investment and financial ties.\nResponsible Optimization of Oil and Gas\nOptimizing the use of these resources and creating a balance between reserves and production, and between economic diversification and the degree of depletion.\n• Managing the oil and gas sector, a catalyst and engine for advanced technological innovations, and a participant in human resource development and economic capacity building\n• Make intense efforts to develop the gas industry and rank it as a source of clean energy for Qatar and the world.\n• Maintaining strategic oil and gas reserves on long-term grounds for reasons of national security and sustainable development.\n• Appropriate economic diversification • A diversified economy whose dependence on hydrocarbon activities is diminishing and the role of the private sector increasing and its competitiveness is increasing through the following stages:\n• Expansion of competitive industries and services derived from hydrocarbon industries.\n• Formulating and developing economic activities for Qatar, and building technical and human capacities for the requirements of these activities.\nA knowledge economy characterized by heavy reliance on research, development and innovation, and excellence in entrepreneurship, high-level education aimed at economic development and community development, advanced physical and information infrastructure, and government institutions that provide the services required by society in an efficient, transparent, and sincere manner and gain the trust of the beneficiaries of these services. • Fourth Cornerstone: Environmental Development\nState of Qatar seeks to protect and preserve its natural environment that God has identified. Therefore, Qatar will carry out the development process with great care on the environment and out of a sense of responsibility towards it, so it accurately balances the requirements of economic and social development with the conditions for preserving the environment.\nEnvironmental Cornerstone will increase in importance when Qatar is forced to deal with local environmental issues such as the effects of depletion of water resources and hydrocarbon, and the effects of pollution on the degradation of the ecosystem, in addition to dealing with global environmental issues such as the effects of global warming on water levels in Qatar and thus on the coastal urban phase. Assessing risk severity and dealing with anticipated changes requires the mobilization of energies and concerted efforts to address the problems that may arise from it. The State shall conserve the environment and the natural balance thereof in order to achieve comprehensive and sustainable development for all generations.\nPermeant Constitution\n\" We need to pay attention to our natural environment that God Almighty has entrusted to us in trust, so that we can invest it with responsibility and respect for the good of mankind. There is no doubt that our environment will reciprocate us if we are ahead in our interest in it.\" • Shiekha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned\nTargeted Goals:\nbalancing between meeting immediate needs and environmental conservation requirements.\nPreserving and protecting the environment, including air, land, water and biological diversity, is done by:\n• An environmentally conscious people who wish to preserve the environmental heritage in Qatar and in neighboring countries.\n• A flexible and comprehensive legislative system that aims to protect all components of the environment and responds to developments.\n• Building an effective and developed environmental institution that strengthens the general sense of the importance of environmental safety and uses the latest technologies to preserve it. These institutions organize environmental awareness programs, develop plans to protect the environment, and conduct relevant research.\n• Supporting international efforts to reduce the harmful effects of climate change.\n• Establishing a comprehensive plan at the State level that adopts a clear policy for urban expansion and population distribution.\n• Encouraging regional cooperation between countries surrounding the Persian Gulf to adopt preventive measures that mitigate the negative impacts on the region’s environment from pollution resulting from its economic activities.\n• Playing a proactive and prominent regional role in assessing and mitigating the negative impacts of climate change, especially to Gulf region countries.\nVision Realization\nQatar National Vision provides a basis for formulating a comprehensive national strategy. This strategy will help to develop development goals according to priorities, clarify the necessary operational processes, the roles of stakeholders, and set standards for measuring performance. As a later step, the General Secretariat for Development Planning and under the guidance of the State's top leadership will coordinate efforts to formulate the comprehensive national strategy, in full consultation and partnership with the relevant authorities, especially civil society, the private sector, ministries and other government institutions. The General Secretariat will also encourage all parties to participate extensively in these efforts to ensure a correct understanding of the dimensions of this vision and a commitment to achieving it.\nThe national strategy will be implemented in the medium term to ensure substantive progress in the path of The National Vision, and will provide a general and integrated framework for coherent sectoral strategies that include plans, programs and projects developed and formulated to help achieve the vision.\nAchieving this vision is a national responsibility. The Qatari society in all its sectors and economic sectors has an important role to play in this regard. This requires developing the necessary institutional and organizational capabilities, providing efficient and transparent public services, supporting fruitful cooperation and partnerships between the public and private sectors, providing a dynamic environment for the business sector and providing a broader scope of its civil society activity."
